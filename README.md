# Adv-Dealership-Project
## Description of the Project
The purpose of this application is to help a car dealership manage its vehicle inventory, sales, and leases through a simple console-based interface. It allows dealership staff to search, add, sell, and remove vehicles while keeping all transactions recorded in external files. This structure ensures accurate record-keeping, improves customer service, and provides a foundation for future dealership management features.

## User Stories
As a salesperson, I want to sell or lease a vehicle so I can update the dealership's records.
As a system, I want to save all contracts to a CSV file so that dealership records are persisted.
As a system, I want to save all contracts to a CSV file so that dealership records are persisted.
As a customer, I want to finance a purchased vehicle if the price is high.
As an administrator, I want to review all contracts to monitor dealership activity.
As a developer, I want the code to follow object-oriented design principles for easier maintenance.


## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.
I open IntelliJ and start a new Java project, then I name the project, right-click the src folder, and create a new Java class. I paste my code into that file. If I’m using a CSV file like transactions.csv, I make sure it’s in the project folder or fix the path in the code. After that, I just hit the green play button or right-click the file and run it—the app shows up in the terminal at the bottom.
